    "### 1.1 Some takeaway for real estate for rent data analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to Part 01 which analize real estate for sell, I can conclude that the distribution of real estates are uneven by districts in Ho Chi Minh city, which in term result in them having signature type of real estate. \n",
    "\n",
    "There has been a lot of interesting discoveries and real world connection that I was able to make from exploring this real estate dataset, which was interesting. The thing that surprised me the most was simply how expensive real estates are, and how cost differ from Districts, and from Property types. From a student standpoint, it gives me some context as for what to expect in the future interm of housing costs, which makes me realize what my prospects ought to be. I was wary of real estate cost at first (fears of being unable to afford my own place), but now, knowing (a little bit more) about the cost structure and real estate market (for rent) make me feel more confident and feel like be prepared to make a more informed decision when the time come.\n",

    "\n",
    "The hardest things for me doing this project was to understand the data set and consolidate what is it that I want to ask. In class we are taught how to *understand the data* and *ask meaningful question*, but being in a real situation with real artifacts to work with is very different. I forget about a lot of things, and I didn't have a clear cut ways to do things. In short, I was quite lost and didn't know what to do and how to do it **right**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:grey\">\n",
    "---\n",
    "</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "To *understand the data*, I realized I had to know about some of it background and the context of data. I realize I have to ask questions about the data itself in hopes of ever be able to extracts anything useful from it. \n",
    "- Where does this data come from?\n",
    "- How is the data created?\n",
    "- Who is creating the data? and for whom?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answering these questions gives clarity to my understanding of the data. Still, it's the first step to asking question, not the last. \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:grey\">\n",
    "---\n",
    "</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To *ask meaningful question*, I have to know what I was interested in. That was a hard thing to do for me, because I tend to ask very broad questions and not quite knowing what I wanted to to **know**. After working on the project, there are some tips I've developed to help:\n",
    "\n",
    "> From what character's point of view am I viewing the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially what this is saying is I'm treating a dataset like a story, and I have to choose a character in that story's perspective to make sense of anything. There have to be a constant (perspective) to make sense of things because people understand things in the form of story. In my analysis, I take a perspective of a young real estate broker who want to understand the real estate renting market in Ho Chi Minh city. I found defining the perspective is very important, becuase asking a question from a my point of view (a person who barely know anything about real estate) is different from the perspective of my parents (home owners) or of real estate agents (have access to large and accurate real estate data).\n",

What you don't know is when I did that at first, I still didn't know what I wanted to ask. Only after I could provide an example of very specific questions under that question can I understand what answer. For example, take the first sub question of the first question that I post.\n",

    "<span style=\"color:grey\">*How are the number of real estate for rent distributed across districts in Ho Chi Minh city?*</span>\n",

Generative AI (ChatGPT) has been helpful in this regards, but I'm hoping to improve my code time and code quality with more practice."

    "#### 1.2.2 Productivity and personal difficulties\n",
    "\n",
    "This semester was an intense experience for me and for a lot of my friends as well. Almost if not all of the people I know in third year really struggled to keep up with studying and the amount of work they have to do. One of the thing that I had to undertake this year is staying up really late to complete my work - which personally was liberating timewise (I get to have more time) but it effects a lot of my health, and I believe it does with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are others things that comes up as well, and it has been difficult. Everything was messy. Watching the people around me succome to falling off their sleep schedule, not taking care of their health and burning out didn't help me realize what to do. What did was a personal crisis that sook my system to it cores, and it make me realize that I have to prioritize important things, over spending hours on ends on a problem I don't care about to get decent grades (I am not an honour student anyway). Time like this forces me to identify what was important and what I wanted to do. I HAD to choose, and in the end, I realized I can't have everything, and for the things I did choose, I have to respect it and show up, and actually try to work on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "And it always start now. The thing is, I can't wait till this (semester) is all over to start living. I have to do it know. And I started following that, which means I would to focus my energy to in more important things and literally just let go of others. It has been hard dealing with me not showing up to a lot of things I should be doing (being extreamly irresponsible in some regards), but I began to see things a bit more clearly. Some things matter more, and that's okay. Letting go of things was **very hard**, but it was my lesson that I'm trying to learn.\n",

    "</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 What I learned\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the things I learned are all stemed from the difficuties that I faced, which I detailed above. But one important things I learned from this semester is the important of working with good teamates. Or rather, what it means to have a good teammate, which I was lucky to have a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "For me, having a good teammate is not having someone who would do all the work for you. It is very important for me that everyone in the team gets to participate and contribute to the project ends. A good teammate is someone who would be able to communicate well (telling me what I did wrong) and ask for help when needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was fortunate to have Huynh Cao Khoi as my teammate for this project. Though we are both unfamiliar with building a DS project, the team was copperative and very open to discussions from small ideas to major. I learned many things from working with Khoi, one of that is his orientation toward structured format and his cares towards designing a good visualization, and how he thinks about the people's experience reading and understanding his analysis. I think putting care into your craft and try to live up to your standard (even though you don't have the necessary experience and knowledge) is admirable. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:grey\">\n",
    "---\n",
    "</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another things that I learn is with our work process. We work in a parallel systems where I handle the rent data and Khoi handle the sell data. It's not a realistic approach because it takes a lot of time and I believe in a work setting people would settle for roles that is more specialize to their ability, but it is a good approach for educational purpose. Having essentially similar dataset makes us relate easily with one another findings while being different enough to **not get in each other ways**. We have had discussion about small details and big ideas in work and about real estate, and I think coming out we know more now than we got started, which is the ultimate goal for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 What I will do next\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 things I would like to do after this project:\n",
    "- Analyze what is/what makes a good question a good question? \n",
    "- Learn more about statistics to understand probability and statistics better\n",
    "- Work on more project (perferably smaller size project) \n",
    "- Work on my planning scheduling skills\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the things I want to do after the project. I want to focus on a limited ammount of things first, stuff like understand questions/problems and improve understanding is important, so I will prioritize those.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Cross review\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is my review of my teammate, Khoi's work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.5.1 Interesting points\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some points in Khoi's work that I found interesting:\n",
    "- His use of interactive graph: This is very good to help visualize and understand the data. Also, because he uses stacked bar chart, it helps a lot to not make the graph overwhelming and hard to see.\n",
    "- His use of `highlighted annotation` are clear and helpful for reading/skimming through the text.\n",
    "- His defined style of graph. It think it shows how meticulous he can be (which is a good thing most of the time).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Strength\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of Khoi shows in his work in his ability to` manage and catagorize notebook`, and his meticulous attention to details of his analyis. The structure he choose are simple and logical, introduce the context, guiding the reader to get to know the data with graphs, give comments and summarise. Being consistent with practice takes attention and care, and I think it's shows in his work. His questions are also more discrete than mine, so I rely much on his suggestions moving along with my analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with Khoi, I also notice that he's a hard working person, and knows how to organize his work. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Weakness\n",
    "\n",
    "The weakness of Khoi shows not in his final products (I'm reading it again but all I realize is that I'm not very good at judging things) but in his work process. Khoi is hard working and a bit of a perfectionist, which prone him overwork himself and sometimes to burn out. I think feeling the need to tend to everything at once and make it good is important but knowing what is really that you're doing and what is the goal is very important too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saying this, I don't think I'm any better. This is a lesson I'm still learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, many of his shortcomings are similar to mine. Our lack of domain knowledge, lack of application of statistics (comes in the form of using descriptive parameters, frequencies of using charts like boxplot), and taking a lot of times to work things out.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "That's then end of my analysis and work on this project. I'd like to express my gratitute for everyone who has helped me complete this project.\n",
