## 1. Introduction 
The project aim to collect, analyse and build ML models to predict real estate services cost in Ho Chi Minh city, by going step by step through phases of a Data Science project. The data is collected from [batdongsan.com](https://batdongsan.com.vn/)

## 2. Technologies 
The following technologies are used in the project:
- `cloudscraper`: Light-weight library for web scraping
- `pandas`: Dataframe manipulation for data cleaning and processing
- `numpy`: Array manipulation for basic statistics analysis
- `matplotlib`: Data visualization
- `scikit-learn`: Build and train ML models
- `streamlit`: Deployment for real estate cost prediction web service

## 3. Results 
We found that there are a great variation of cost between the **type** and **location** of a property. (We also need to emphasise that the data is collect from 1 website, which could introduce great bias).
